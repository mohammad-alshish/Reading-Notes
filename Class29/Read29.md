## Whiteboard Advice
- Communication throughout is key! 
- Make sure to restate the question so you prove to yourself and the interviewer that you know the problem domain. 
- Example of restating the fizzbuzz question:
```
“So I’d like to restate the problem to you to make sure I understand what you’re looking for. The sole parameter for my function will be an integer. The sole output of my function will be an incrementing array, starting from the number 1 and ending at the input number.

If a number is a multiple of 3, the output will instead be `fizz`. If a number is a multiple of 5, the output will instead be `buzz`. However, if the output is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output will instead be `fizzbuzz`. Is my understanding correct?”
```
- Make sure to ask about edge cases
- By stating edge cases, it shows you will be good at preventing bugs.
- Example of asking about edge cases:
```
“Now that I confirmed my understanding of the problem, I’d like to ask about some potential edge cases. Is it possible that the input would be a type other than a number? If so, what should the function do? Can the input be 0 or negative? Again, if so, what should the function do?”
```
- Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.
- Write pseudo code and check your logic. 
- When translating pseudo code to code, and you forget syntax or method, ask interviewer. If they give you trouble, then just say you will leave as pseudo code for now. 

## 7 Tips:

1. Take a few minutes
  - You can ask for a few mins to think the problem through. Just communicate you are going to do so. 
2. Write down steps of the solution
  - Basically, this is the alogorithm portion of whiteboarding. 
3. Write pseudocode first
  - Pseudo code defined as some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work.
  - Just verify the logic is correct
4. Don't sweat the small stuff
  - Technical interviews are about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personal strengths, and problem-solving abilities. 
  - Brush off mistakes and move on.
5. Sit down. Be humble. 
  - When given critiques, take it and be grateful! DO NOT be defensive! 
6. Come prepared
  - This is good for your state of mind in and after the interview.
7. Review your work 
  - If you have time, review your work! If your work is wrong, you still have time to correct it. 
  - These two areas are really important to review:
    - Algorithmic efficiency: Review whether or not you have found the fastest and most optimal solution given the requirements. 
    - Correctness: Check for edge cases and off-by-one errors. At least look for ways to improve the correctness of your solution.
