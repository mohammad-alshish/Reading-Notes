# List Comprehensions

for the reading task for this class we go through some resocres about the lists handling , This is a very important subject , because after reading and skimming the ideas ,examples, etc....
I figure out we can do A lot of functoinllty by using thses information
This is way I will show you the most important ideas and some examples also with some description.

- Old way example:
```
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
```

- New way example:
```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```
- Basic syntax:
```
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]
```
- Equiv to:
```
for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression
```
- Breaking the below example down:
```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```
- new_list: The new list (result).
- expression(i): Expression is based on the variable used for each element in the old list.
- for i in old_list: The word for followed by the variable name to use, followed by the word in the old list.
- if filter(i): Apply a filter with an If-statement.
- Another example:
```
new_range = [i * i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0]

Which corresponds to:

*result* = [*transform* *iteration* *filter* ]
```
- Creating a simple list:
```
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x

# This will give the output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
- Create a list using loops and list comprehension:
```
# You can either use loops:
squares = []

for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
 
print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Or you can use list comprehensions to get the same result:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```
- Multiplying parts of a list
```
list1 = [3,4,5]
 
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] 
 
print multiplied 
[9,12,15]
```
- Show the first letter of each word
```
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]

items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]

print items
```
- Lower/Upper case converter
```
>>> [x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]]
['a', 'b', 'c']

>>> [x.upper() for x in ["a","b","c"]]
['A', 'B', 'C']
```
- Print numbers only from a given string
```
string = "Hello 12345 World"
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]
print numbers

>> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
```
- Parsing a file using list comprehension
```
In this example, we can see how to get specific lines out from a text file.

Create a text file and put in some text in it.

this is line1
this is line2
this is line3
this is line4
this is line5

Save the file as test.txt

# Then create the filter by using list comprehension:

fh = open("test.txt", "r")

result = [i for i in fh if "line3" in i]

print result
Output: [‘this is line3
‘]
```
- Using list comprehension in functions
```
Now, let’s see how we can use list comprehension in functions.

# Create a function and name it double:
def double(x):
  return x*2

# If you now just print that function with a value in it, it should look like this:
>>> print double(10)
20
We can easily use list comprehension on that function.

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

print double
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

# You can put in conditions:

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]

# You can add more arguments:

>>> [x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]
[30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
```



## Things I want to know more about
1- as usual Ineed to know and understand BigO fully without any mistakes.
2- I know this is far from the reading for this class but the thing I want to know more and more about the linked-list..
