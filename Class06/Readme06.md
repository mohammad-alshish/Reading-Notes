## How to use Random Module
How to use the Random Module in Python ?

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

The Random module contains some very useful functions.

Randint => if we wanted a random integer .

Choice => Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

Random => If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.


# What is risk analysis
risk is the probabilty of any unwanted incidents.
in software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas
when a test plan is created, risks involved in testing product are taken into consideration along with possibilty of damage they may cause to softare
potential risks
use of new hardware
use of enw tech
use of new automation tool
sequence of code
availability of test resources for app
unavoidable risks
time allocated for testing
defect leakage due to complexity or size of app
urgency from clients
incomplete reqs
risk magnitude indicators
high - effect of risk very high and non-tolerable
medium - tolerable but not desired
low - tolerable
risk identification
business risk - risk coming from your company or customer not from project
testing risk
premature release risk
software risk
risk assessment
effect
cause
likelihood
three steps
search for the risk
analyze impact of each risk
measures for risk identified
Test Coverage
test coverage is auseful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase
higher coverage numbers don't always mean good
high nubmers are easy to reach with low quality testing
tests can look for things that rarely go wron while distracting from testing things that really matter
testing requires thoughtfulness
if you are testing well 80-90% is great
100% is a little suspicious
you are doing enough testing if the following is true:
you rarely get bugs that escape into production
you are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs
if your tests are slowing you down or if simple code changes causes excessively long changes to tests, there may be a problem with the testa
true value of coverage analysis is that it helps you find bits of code that aren't being tested
Big O
In South Africa, the pigeon carrying the USB is O(1) while the data transfer time over the internet is O(N).
Imagine mowing a 100x100 plot of land. It would be O(A) or area or O(S^2) or sides squared
Big O rules
different steps get added
drop constants
different inputs -> different variables
drop non-dominant terms

## Things I want to know more about
1. full descripition of BigO.
2.  Classes,Objects and  Modules
