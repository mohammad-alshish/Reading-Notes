## My notes

- In the terminal you can use arrows up and down to select a command from your history so you don't write it again. And you can edit it using right and left arrows.
- cd which stands for change directory takes you to the file directory it's like open folder in windows,But to achevie this you need to write the correct path to move in my case for instance I have a *Dir* called Reading-Notes so if I want to work in this directory  I Should write `cd/Reading-Notes/` Otherwise If I use `cd ~` Alone I will remain im my main directory or go back to it if I was already in a Directory.
- Alot maybe face a problem while worimg in terminal because everyone want to be fast as can as possible , This is easy to move smoothly between directories and files always use `ls` to check the spelling of the names this really gonna be helpful + use `TAB` as much as you can this gonna make the navigation faster.
- Now let's talk about Removing items from your local machince there's a lot of commands that you can use but I prefer `rm -rf` because it's force delete to simplfy this it's = `Shift` + `Delete` in windows so please be carefull when you use it .
- One of the most important commands that you will need is the`install`
to add what you need tp your LM to help you about this.
- At the end I can give you all advice is used what you already know from commands or what are you sure about because you  don't want grom your LM  to misbehave.
